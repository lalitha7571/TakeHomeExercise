# TakeHomeExercise
**Prerequisites** : **Node JS, VSCode IDE**
**Step 1** :** Clone the project - TakeHomeExercise**
**Step 2** : **Install Playwright**
**Programming Language** : **TypeScript** 

**Please use the following commands to run the project : **
- **npx playwright test --headed**
- If you don't have playwright installed use : **npm install playwright**
- If you encounter any errors with your node package manager make sure you do an **npm cache clean **

I have utilized the Playwright automation library from Node.js and chose my primary language as typescript. I have approached the problem via a ** Divide and conquer Algorithm ** which is the most optimal solution for this problem
